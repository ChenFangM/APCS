Randy Pausch's Last Lecture

I think that the lecture was so inspirational, touching, and comedic all at the same time. There is much wisdom learned from watching the lecture and hearing Pausch walk over some of his dreams and experiences.

He speaks with so much sincerely for his students and family. I had some laughs at his jokes and some tears at the his interactions with his wife on stage.
