HW06 -- "Hello, world!" in Different Coding Languages
2021-09-28

Similarities:
- Python, Scheme, and NetLogo all use some form of the define command to define a function. 
- All use the print command with "<string>" to display a string.

Differences:
- Syntax (e.g. Scheme heavily uses parenthesis to contain a function)
- Ending (e.g. NetLogo uses the end command to signal the end of a function, and Scheme signals such with the closing parenthesis)
