==================
Activity 1
==================

Q1 --
a. public static double sentimentVal()
b. Yes, it requires a String. If you pass a different type of parameter, the
file is no longer compliable and the terminal prints out "error: incompatible
types".
c. Yes, it returns a double.

Q2 --
Method Call                     Return Value
sentimentVal("why")             0.34
sentimentVal("did I")           0.0
sentimentVal("overthink")       0.0

Q3 --
a. It will compile because there is a singular String parameter given. Also,
sentimentVal() is a double, so you can set a double variable as the called
method.
b. It will NOT compile because it inputs a double and attempts to set a String
as the called method, creating two cases of incompatible types.
c. It will NOT compile because it inputs two String, but sentimentVal() only
accepts one String argument.

==================
Activity 2
==================

Q1 & Q2 --
Edited Review.java; terminal returned 4.109999999999999.

Q4 --
It iterates through the file, searching for spaces, and once that is found,
totalSentiments() will classify everything prior to the space as a word and
find the sentimentVal(). Then, everything from prior to the space would be
removed, and the function will continue iterating through the rest, summing up
all the sentiment values. This will continue until nothing is left and the total
is returned.

Q5 --
a. Not particularly because the sentiments have to be really high in order to
return a good rating.
b. We can multiply total sentiment by some factor or we can check the rating
against the input word count.

Q6 --
He should reversed the comparison sign around because in his current code, no
matter if the total sentiment is 0 or 14, it will always return 4.

==================
Activity 3
==================

Q3 --
The method indexOf() returns the index of a character in a String; substring()
returns part of a String, beginning from the specified start index up to the
specified end index. These methods can be used to divide a string into two parts
by finding the index of the character you want to split at and creating two
separate substrings. The first substring will have all the characters from the
first character up until the character at the specified index. The second
substring will contain the rest of the characters of the original string.

Q5 --
The difference between calling static methods as opposed to calling non-static
methods is that for static methods, it can be called without creating an
instance of Review. On the other hand, an instance of a class has to be created
to access the non-static method.

Q6 --
fakeReview() can be modified by using randomPositiveAdj() or randomNegativeAdj()
to create a (strictly) fake positive review or a (strictly) fake negative
review.

==================
Activity 4
==================

Q1 --
You want to troll something you really dislike.

Q2 --
You want to support something you fervently like.

Q3 --
Instead of a review that might be negative or positive, we can create a solely
positive one as to avoid randomness.

Q5 --
Removes first index.

Q6 --
Not removing it might cause an exception where no sentimentVal is returned.

Q7 --
Yes, if every chance of negativity is removed and only positive adjectives are
used.
